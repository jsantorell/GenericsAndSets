    Lab #1 – practice overriding equals(), hashCode() and toString(). 
    In the “GenericsAndSets” sample project you will find three classes in the “common” package.
    They are Address, Dog and Employee. For each of these classes create overrides of the equals(),
    hashCode and toString() methods using the Netbeans wizard as described above.
    Make choices as appropriate based on what you learned so far today.
    Consider further customizing the toString() method. Share your results with your instructor.
